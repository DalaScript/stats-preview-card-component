### What I learned

Nothing special, it didn’t take much time to complete. It was a simple project, but still a good experience.

### Continued development

I have already completed two JavaScript courses on freeCodeCamp, and I am currently taking the Front End Development Libraries course, where I’ve finished Bootstrap, jQuery, and Sass, and I’m now working through React.

Alongside this, I am working on projects and following a learning path on Frontendmentor.
